QR-based Dine-in Ordering and POS System

## 📌 Overview
The Ordering Management System, combined with a Point-of-Sale (POS) module, aims to create a faster, more organized, and error-free workflow. Through automation, the system will remove unnecessary manual steps and improve how staff and customers interact with the ordering and billing process.
The system will also unify all ordering stations including the dine-in area, cashier station, and barbecue station into one digitally connected process. This ensures orders are properly tracked, efficiently transmitted, and accurately billed, improving overall service quality for customers and operational efficiency for staff.

## 🎯 Features
The project aims to deliver a complete Ordering Management System focused on automation and seamless process integration. The scope includes the development of:
- A QR-based Ordering Web Application for customers, allowing each dine-in table to place orders directly.
- A Point-of-Sale (POS) System for cashier staff, enabling efficient billing, payment processing, and management of take-out orders.
- A connected and streamlined ordering workflow between customers, cashiers, and kitchen staff.
The system will focus on improving accuracy, speed, and coordination across all ordering-related operations.
